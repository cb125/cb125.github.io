# Teaching

* ***Undergrad***: 
  * **Meaning**: I developed and teach a general-education course called *Meaning*, which is part of the Texts and Ideas component of the Humanities CORE at NYU.  We engage with the work of Aristotle, Bacon, Wittgenstein, Grice, and many others.  Creating meaning is one of the supreme activities of the human species--but what, exactly, are we doing when we create meaning?  How should we think about meaning?  
  * **Introduction to Semantics**: I also teach Introduction to Semantics in the Linguistics department.  This is a problem-set based introduction to the formal study of meaning.  No textbook!
* ***Graduate***:
  * **Beyond Grice**: in Spring 2023, Matt Mandelkern (NYU Philosophy) and I taught a joint seminar looking for the line between semantics and pragmatics.
  * **Keeping Track of Conversations: Scoreboards, Semantics and Psychology**: in Spring 2022, Liz Camp, Andy Egan and I taught a joint Rutgers/NYU seminar rethinking the role of language in communication.  What's so special about truth, anyway?
  * **Dynamic Semantics**: I taught a seminar in spring of 2021 on Dynamic Semantics.  Course materials and a lightly annotated bibliography are available [here](https://github.com/cb125/Dynamics).  See also my new draft (just below).
  * **Monads and all that**: Jim Pryor and my course on some beautiful and useful computational techniques [here](http://www.jimpryor.net).
