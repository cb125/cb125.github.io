# Research

This is me doing research.

I'm a semanticist, that is, I study natural language meaning. These days I've been working on scope, dynamics, and update. I talk to linguists, philosophers of language, and computer scientists, and I'm especially interested in adapting techniques from functional programming such as functors, monads, and continuations.


* **Recent projects**:
  * [Composing local contexts](barker-composing-local-contexts.pdf): This is a newly revised version of a paper I drafted in 2008.  It uses an innovative continuation-passing style transform to provide a minimal dynamic semantics on which dynamic effects depend only on truth conditions and order of evaluation.
  * [Rethinking scope islands](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ling_a_00419).  2021. *Linguistic Inquiry*.  Contrary to the standard wisdom, abundant naturally-occuring data shows that clauses are not scope islands.  Preprint and Haskell code available [here](https://github.com/cb125/scope-islands).
  * [The logic of Quantifier Raising](https://doi.org/10.3765/sp.13.20).  2020. *Semantics and Pragmatics*, 13.20.  The first study of the formal properties of Quantifier Raising.  I show that QR is decidable, even in the presence of unrestricted type lifting.  Surprizingly, QR with type lifting validates Hendriks' Flexible Montague Grammar type shifters.
  * [NL-lambda as the Logic of Scope and Movement](https://rdcu.be/cdsdC). 2019. *Journal of Logic, Language and Information* **28**, 217–237.  Decidability, interpolation, and soundness and completeness proofs for a logic with Quantifier Raising and a unit, which can characterize both overt and covert movement.
